			<p>I once saw an old Romanian brig moored at the tourist dock in Mangalia. This has instantly awaken my longing for seas and sailing. When I was a kid, I relished reading Jules Verne. As his novels were full of sailors, I got very fond of sailing (and traveling in general). That old brig made me long to sail for real, so in the next years I pondered on the idea.</p>

			<p>After a couple of years, I've found the time to join my first sailing course at the RYA training center Elite Sailing, in Chatham, UK. I've chosen that center because it has good reviews, it's close to London, and the plane to London is cheap. I chose RYA because a friend of mine took the Day Skipper course there and told me how it was. I chose UK because I wanted something less tourist-centered - whoever is willing to endure the tough weather conditions to sail is probably really passionate about it. Those rough conditions also help with learning: you've got consistent tide, wind, rain, fog, cold, and busy channels as a bonus.</p>

				<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/155876851@N05/48706997927/in/album-72157710705607746/" title="pers-sail-competent-crew"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48706997927_c086c42639_z.jpg" class="imageblock-img" alt="pers-sail-competent-crew"></a>
			</div>


			<p>I've got my RYA Competent Crew certificate. I've spent 10 days navigating on channels, out of which 8 night hours. My log book counts 170 nautical miles aboard. Next I want to become a Day Skipper.</p>

			<p>I dream of crossing the ocean sometimes... And no, there's not even the sea in this picture; it's only the mouth of the Medway River.</p>

			</div>


			<p>For now, I've gathered some learning materials: books, training charts, plotter, dividers, a toy yacht (see below), sailing simulators. When I have some spare time I try to learn something new related to sailing. It was easier with Competent Crew; with Day Skipper things are starting to get serious. I want to get good at this - skippering a boat is a great responsibility, it's not just about dreaming, longing and traveling...</p>

			<h1>"Black Fortress"</h1>

			<p class="subtitle">
				<span>Toy</span>
			</p>

			<div class="imageblock">
				<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/155876851@N05/49192282882/in/dateposted-public/" title="pers-toy-black-fortress-overview"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49192282882_3909591f1c_c.jpg" class="imageblock-img" alt="pers-toy-black-fortress-overview"></a>
			</div>


			<p>To my son's request, I built a toy fortress. I liked doing it, although it wasn't easy!</p>

			<p>Initially I thought of making it from plywood, but following a friend's suggestion I chose foam-board. That was a really good thing, as you can cat foam-board much easily than plywood. You just need a sharp knife or cutter. (I got some help from my wife with cutting as there was still a lot of work to do.)</p>

			<div class="imageblock">
				<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/155876851@N05/49191588383/in/dateposted-public/" title="pers-toy-black-fortress-aerial"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49191588383_4d5c0ede8d_c.jpg"  class="imageblock-img" alt="pers-toy-black-fortress-aerial"></a>
			</div>

			<p>For a toy, it's pretty big - it has 1 m by 0.9 m. The front towers are bigger than the back ones. The donjon is 70 cm high. You can put a lot of things in it. My kids have a lot of small plastic figurines and accessories (beds, tables, closets, food, etc.) and they use a lot of them in the castle. We've also organized a few battles using toy catapults and guns and projectiles made of aluminum foil.</p>

			<div class="imageblock">
				<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/155876851@N05/49177516048/in/dateposted-public/" title="pers-toy-black-fortress-ground-level"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49177516048_3aa4a38905_c.jpg" class="imageblock-img" alt="pers-toy-black-fortress-ground-level"></a>
			</div>

			<p>To build it, I started by getting an idea of its size using some figurines and wooden building blocks we had in the house. I chose a typical figurine as my initial "measuring unit" and I draw a sketch of the castle, noting down sizes in "figurines" ("omule»õi" in the sketch which is in Romanian).</p>

			<div class="imageblock">
				<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/155876851@N05/49191588088/in/dateposted-public/" title="pers-toy-black-fortress-sketch"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49191588088_65f37bf1d1_c.jpg" class="imageblock-img" alt="pers-toy-black-fortress-sketch"></a>
			</div>

			<p>Then I did the detailed sketches and established how much material I will need. I took each part of the fortress, determined how I'll build it and the sizes for each part. I've grouped parts so as to minimize the number of foam-boards I order. I've also established the position of windows and doors.</p>

			<div class="imageblock">
				<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/155876851@N05/49191588538/in/dateposted-public/" title="pers-toy-black-fortress-materials"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49191588538_0c48b54822_c.jpg" class="imageblock-img" alt="pers-toy-black-fortress-materials"></a>
			</div>

			<p>Once I've found myself with a plan and a bunch of foam-boards, I've started work! I drew the cutting contours on the foam-boards, I cut, made holes for screws, and assembled everything together.</p>

			<p>A problem I faced was assembling everything together. I didn't plan for it as I wasn't sure how to do it. Once I saw myself in front of many cut pieces, I've started thinking. Doing something like for the 3D puzzles seemed too much work and a fragile result. Then, I've considered using adhesive to tie them together, but it wouldn't hold and made the hold thing un-dismountable (which would have been a bad thing given it's size). I've even considered scotch tape. I've finally chosen screws and bolts, which allows for dismounting the thing, it's pretty easy to do (I made the holes for the screws with a stitching awl) and holds up pretty well (foam-board is pretty solid, the black one being tougher than the white one).</p>

			<p>Considering all the work I did with preparations, sketches, drawing on the material, cutting and assembling, I would say it took me around 24h of effective time to do this project.</p>

			<h1>Folding Bridge</h1>

			<p class="subtitle">

			<div class="imageblock">
				<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/155876851@N05/48706630051/in/album-72157710705607746/" title="pers-toy-bridge-raised"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48706630051_8899f071d7_c.jpg" class="imageblock-img" alt="pers-toy-bridge-raised"></a>
			</div>


			<p>The bridge is 100cm long; the maximum height allowed under the top rod is 49cm - this was computed so that my boy's toy sailing ship  clears it, without making the bridge too high, though.</p>


			<p>When the bridge is stretched, one can use it to move toy cars on it.</p>

			<div class="imageblock">
				<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/155876851@N05/48706295043/in/album-72157710705607746/" title="pers-toy-bridge"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48706295043_206276cdac_c.jpg" class="imageblock-img"  alt="pers-toy-bridge"></a>
			</div>


			<p>I've made it dismountable, although you do need to unscrew a few nuts for this. The top rods are attached to the poles by metric screws, that are easily introduced or taken out in the larger holes I drilled on both elements. The platform is attached to the poles in a similar way.</p>


			<p>For folding I used door hinges. They allow the platforms to go lower than in the picture. To hold them horizontally, I've used a couple of strings that I attached to the screws from the top of the bridge.</p>

			<p>It took me about 8h to make it. There was quite some work to make the diagonal cuts for the sloped platforms, as well as making the holes for the screws fit together.</p>

			<h1>Toy Learning Yacht</h1>


			<p class="subtitle">
				<span>Hobby / Toy</span>
			</p>

			<div class="imageblock">
				<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/155876851@N05/49029080716/in/dateposted-public/" title="pers-toy-yacht"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49029080716_907895faee_b.jpg" alt="pers-toy-yacht" class="imageblock-img"></a>
			</div>


			<p>This is a toy yacht that I use for practicing and remembering sailing basics and my kids use for playing and getting a look into sailing.</p>


			<h3>Description</h3>


			<p>Since I've discovered my passion for sailing, I travel regularly to the UK to take RYA courses. As UK is not quite close to my home and time and budget don't let me go there all the time, as soon as I returned from my first course, I started pondering creating something to help me rehearse sail points and other basic stuff.</p>


			<p>So the toy above was born. It has:</p>


			<ul>


				<li>A deck, obviously.</li>


				<li>Mast, mainsail, a system for hoisting the mainsail that mimics the boom, main halyard, mainsheet, reefing pennant, kicker strap, and topping lift.</li>


				<li>Jib - here I improvised a mast, although the boats I practice on have a roller-furling jib. It was easier to build this way and I'm not impeded too much by this as I can still easily remember the steps for getting out the jib. I do have the jib sheets which help me remember the actions. I also have something that help me turn the sheet around like I do with winches.</li>


				<li>Cleats. I've 4 cleats, two near the mast, and one close to the jib and helm. They help with remembering maneuvers for docking and leaving a mooring.</li>


				<li>Mooring lines. The toy has 4 mooring lines, one for bow line, one for stern line, and 2 springs. They do not appear in the picture above.</li>


				<li>I also have a couple of other ropes with I use to practice knots.</li>


				<li>Helm. It's not essential to my rehearsal, but I did it for the kids. It helps with "realism", too.</li>

			</ul>

			<div class="imageblock">
				<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/155876851@N05/49028567678/in/dateposted-public/" title="pers-toy-yacht-detail"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49028567678_a55288c701_c.jpg" class="imageblock-img" alt="pers-toy-yacht-detail"></a>
			</div>


			<h3>Usage</h3>


			<p>I use the toy yacht to rehearse some actions that are done on a sailing yacht:</p>


			<ul>


				<li>Hoisting, reefing, and lowering the sails.</li>


				<li>Sail points. The stick from the top of the mast is the "wind indicator". I set it manually, of course, but it helps me to remember how do I need to trim the sails on various wind directions.</li>


				<li>Gybing and tacking.</li>


				<li>Mooring. I use the cleats to remember usage of the mooring lines. I can also play mooring to a buoy using a random object as the buoy.</li>


				<li>Coming to a mooring, leaving a mooring. I also have another indicator which I use to indicate tide direction. I set up various wind and tide directions and then think what are the maneuvers to get the boat safely to its target. Sometimes I act on those maneuvers by tying/untying the lines, pushing the boat around.</li>

			</ul>

			<div class="sidenote-div">
				<span class="sidenote-title">Side note</span>
				<p>I've started to use the <a href="https://www.esailyachtsimulator.com/">eSail</a> sailing simulator quite some time ago and it's really helpful for the newbie.  I wrote a detailed review for it <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/794860/discussions/0/3056239973546618089/#c3056240878553180373">here</a>.</p>
				<p>I've also tried <a href="https://www.sailsimulator.com/game-info/free-demo-version">Sail Simulator 5 Demo</a> for rehearsing gybing and tacking. The demo supports a single boat type, a Laser. Although a Laser is very different from a Sloop, it's way better when it comes to getting wind awareness as compared to my toy yacht. Because it's real-time and it simulates boat reactions very well (including capsizing...), it forces you to think as you would on a real boat. Of course, you miss the physical things - the wobbling, pulling the actual ropes, turning the actual wheel, etc. But for someone that doesn't have access to a boat every week, such a simulator is very useful in keeping in touch with sail trimming and points.</p>
				<p>Still, my toy yacht is still useful when it comes to rehearsing hoisting and lowering the sails: when I touch the ropes I've installed there, I remember the feeling I have on the real boat, and it helps.</p>
				<p>There's also <a href="https://sailaway.world/">Sailaway</a>, but as I'm writing this it had many bugs, and it didn't support mooring. There is work in progress for version 3, which promises a lot of new features for learning.</p>
			</div>


			<h3>Building</h3>


			<p>Here's how I did it:</p>


			<ul>


				<li>The deck is an ordinary pinewood board from a hardware store. It has 125x25 cm.</li>


				<li>The mast is a piece of timber that measures 190 cm in height and 2x5 cm in width.</li>


				<li>The foremast is a combination of a piece of timber and a thin pole.</li>


				<li>The steering wheel is mounted on another piece of timber. To create it, first I drew the cut out lines, then I drilled holes with en electric drill, and finally I cut on the lines using a narrow-bladed electrical saw.</li>


				<li>For attaching the masts to the deck I used small corner brackets.</li>


				<li>For the rotative elements (wheel, boom) I used screws with 2 nuts tightened on each other so that the the rotative element doesn't go anywhere and can rotate freely at the same time.</li>


				<li>For the sails I used some linen that I had available. I cut them to the desired shape, then I burned their margins with the soldering iron.</li>


				<li>To create the mainsail hoisting mechanism, I created some holes on the luff of my linen sail. I took a rope and put it through each hole, alternating sides. On top of the mast I mounted a pulley through which I passed the rope. At the mast base I mounted another pulley which leads the line towards the wheel. Thus I can hoist the sail by pulling at the mast and then taking up the slack at the cockpit, just as on a real boat.</li>


				<li>The wind and tide "indicators" are thin ice-cream sticks, cut out to be pointed, and mounted using drawing pins.</li>

			</ul>

			<p>I would say it took me 16h overall to create it as I presented it above. I made most of it in a single day (say, 8h), then I added elements as they came to my mind.</p>

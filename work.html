				</div>

				<ul>

					<li><b>What does it do</b>: Defines the work methodology for a team of programmers working for a data processing department. The programmers have projects that range from a tiny conversion tool that's doable in 1 hour to a 1-year web site. The majority of these projects are data processing tools. Project requirements are subject to change on the way. The final product quality is very important, as well as respecting the estimations.</li>

					<li><b>My role</b>: Conceive, document, implement.</li>

					<li><b>What have I learned</b>: Identify a problem, find a solution. Believe in a proven solution and lead the way in implementing it.</li>

					<li><b>Context</b>: Personal initiative in Softwin SRL.</li>

					<li><b>Side notes</b>: I couldn't use Agile, because it's, well, not enough "agile" for a 1-hour project. The solution came from the way I was working, using automated testing and using a few principles borrowed from Agile and tailored to my needs. In order to create the software process, I wrote those notes in an accessible format, with details and diagrams, I generalized the automated framework I was using, and I instructed the team.</li>

				</div>

				<ul>

					<li><b>What does it do</b>: It's an editor for visually defining and then drawing a fractal. The fractal is defined by first manually drawing a 2D "seed". Starting from the seed, the user can create multiple copies of it, which are initially identical to the seed. The user can rotate, size, skew the copy, and the program learns the relation between each copy and the seed. By activating the "draw" function, the fractal is drawn as follows: the seed is drawn first, then each copy is drawn according to its relation to the seed; then, each copy acts like the seed; and so on until the specified level is hit. The "paint" function applies dots directly at a very high level, considered "infinite"; an optional randomizing aids with realism. With properly defined fractals, the "paint" function produces realistic drawings.</li>

					<li><b>My role</b>: Conceive, implement, test.</li>

					<li><b>What have I learned</b>: Borland Delphi 2.0, debugging.</li>

					<li><b>Context</b>: Side project, during university.</li>

					<li><b>Side notes</b>: During that time, I've also used Delphi to create a pair of virtual eyes that follow the mouse cursor, blink, and fall asleep after an idle period; most of the parameters were editable.</li>

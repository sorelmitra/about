				<p>To my son's request, I built a toy fortress. I liked doing it, although it wasn't easy!</p>

				<p>Initially I thought of making it from plywood, but following a friend's suggestion I chose foam-board. That was a really good thing, as you can cat foam-board much easily than plywood. You just need a sharp knife or cutter. (I got some help from my wife with cutting as there was still a lot of work to do.)</p>

				<p>For a toy, it's pretty big - it has 1 m by 0.9 m. The front towers are bigger than the back ones. The donjon is 70 cm high. You can put a lot of things in it. My kids have a lot of small plastic figurines and accessories (beds, tables, closets, food, etc.) and they use a lot of them in the castle. We've also organized a few battles using toy catapults and guns and projectiles made of aluminum foil.</p>

				</div>

				<p>To build it, I started by getting an idea of its size using some figurines and wooden building blocks we had in the house. I chose a typical figurine as my initial "measuring unit" and I draw a sketch of the castle, noting down sizes in "figurines" ("omule»õi" in the sketch which is in Romanian).</p>

				<div class="imageblock">
					<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/155876851@N05/49191588088/in/dateposted-public/" title="pers-toy-black-fortress-sketch"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49191588088_65f37bf1d1_c.jpg" class="imageblock-img" alt="pers-toy-black-fortress-sketch"></a>
				</div>

				<p>Then I did the detailed sketches and established how much material I will need. I took each part of the fortress, determined how I'll build it and the sizes for each part. I've grouped parts so as to minimize the number of foam-boards I order. I've also established the position of windows and doors.</p>

				</div>

				<p>Once I've found myself with a plan and a bunch of foam-boards, I've started work! I drew the cutting contours on the foam-boards, I cut, made holes for screws, and assembled everything together.</p>

				<p>A problem I faced was assembling everything together. I didn't plan for it as I wasn't sure how to do it. Once I saw myself in front of many cut pieces, I've started thinking. Doing something like for the 3D puzzles seemed too much work and a fragile result. Then, I've considered using adhesive to tie them together, but it wouldn't hold and made the hold thing un-dismountable (which would have been a bad thing given it's size). I've even considered scotch tape. I've finally chosen screws and bolts, which allows for dismounting the thing, it's pretty easy to do (I made the holes for the screws with a stitching awl) and holds up pretty well (foam-board is pretty solid, the black one being tougher than the white one).</p>

				<p>Considering all the work I did with preparations, sketches, drawing on the material, cutting and assembling, I would say it took me around 24h of effective time to do this project.</p>

				<p>The bridge is 100cm long; the maximum height allowed under the top rod is 49cm - this was computed so that my boy's toy sailing ship  clears it, without making the bridge too high, though.</p>

				<p>When the bridge is stretched, one can use it to move toy cars on it.</p>

				<p>I've made it dismountable, although you do need to unscrew a few nuts for this. The top rods are attached to the poles by metric screws, that are easily introduced or taken out in the larger holes I drilled on both elements. The platform is attached to the poles in a similar way.</p>

				<p>For folding I used door hinges. They allow the platforms to go lower than in the picture. To hold them horizontally, I've used a couple of strings that I attached to the screws from the top of the bridge.</p>

				<p>It took me about 8h to make it. There was quite some work to make the diagonal cuts for the sloped platforms, as well as making the holes for the screws fit together.</p>

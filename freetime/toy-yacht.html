				<p>This is a toy yacht that I use for practicing and remembering sailing basics and my kids use for playing and getting a look into sailing.</p>

				<h3>Description</h3>

				<p>Since I've discovered my passion for sailing, I travel regularly to the UK to take RYA courses. As UK is not quite close to my home and time and budget don't let me go there all the time, as soon as I returned from my first course, I started pondering creating something to help me rehearse sail points and other basic stuff.</p>

				<p>So the toy above was born. It has:</p>

				<ul>

					<li>A deck, obviously.</li>

					<li>Mast, mainsail, a system for hoisting the mainsail that mimics the boom, main halyard, mainsheet, reefing pennant, kicker strap, and topping lift.</li>

					<li>Jib - here I improvised a mast, although the boats I practice on have a roller-furling jib. It was easier to build this way and I'm not impeded too much by this as I can still easily remember the steps for getting out the jib. I do have the jib sheets which help me remember the actions. I also have something that help me turn the sheet around like I do with winches.</li>

					<li>Cleats. I've 4 cleats, two near the mast, and one close to the jib and helm. They help with remembering maneuvers for docking and leaving a mooring.</li>

					<li>Mooring lines. The toy has 4 mooring lines, one for bow line, one for stern line, and 2 springs. They do not appear in the picture above.</li>

					<li>I also have a couple of other ropes with I use to practice knots.</li>

					<li>Helm. It's not essential to my rehearsal, but I did it for the kids. It helps with "realism", too.</li>

				</ul>

				<h3>Usage</h3>

				<p>I use the toy yacht to rehearse some actions that are done on a sailing yacht:</p>

				<ul>

					<li>Hoisting, reefing, and lowering the sails.</li>

					<li>Sail points. The stick from the top of the mast is the "wind indicator". I set it manually, of course, but it helps me to remember how do I need to trim the sails on various wind directions.</li>

					<li>Gybing and tacking.</li>

					<li>Mooring. I use the cleats to remember usage of the mooring lines. I can also play mooring to a buoy using a random object as the buoy.</li>

					<li>Coming to a mooring, leaving a mooring. I also have another indicator which I use to indicate tide direction. I set up various wind and tide directions and then think what are the maneuvers to get the boat safely to its target. Sometimes I act on those maneuvers by tying/untying the lines, pushing the boat around.</li>

				</ul>

					<span class="sidenote-title">Side note</span>
					<p>I've started to use the <a href="https://www.esailyachtsimulator.com/">eSail</a> sailing simulator quite some time ago and it's really helpful for the newbie.  I wrote a detailed review for it <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/794860/discussions/0/3056239973546618089/#c3056240878553180373">here</a>.</p>
					<p>I've also tried <a href="https://www.sailsimulator.com/game-info/free-demo-version">Sail Simulator 5 Demo</a> for rehearsing gybing and tacking. The demo supports a single boat type, a Laser. Although a Laser is very different from a Sloop, it's way better when it comes to getting wind awareness as compared to my toy yacht. Because it's real-time and it simulates boat reactions very well (including capsizing...), it forces you to think as you would on a real boat. Of course, you miss the physical things - the wobbling, pulling the actual ropes, turning the actual wheel, etc. But for someone that doesn't have access to a boat every week, such a simulator is very useful in keeping in touch with sail trimming and points.</p>
					<p>Still, my toy yacht is still useful when it comes to rehearsing hoisting and lowering the sails: when I touch the ropes I've installed there, I remember the feeling I have on the real boat, and it helps.</p>
					<p>There's also <a href="https://sailaway.world/">Sailaway</a>, but as I'm writing this it had many bugs, and it didn't support mooring. There is work in progress for version 3, which promises a lot of new features for learning.</p>

				<h3>Building</h3>

				<p>Here's how I did it:</p>

				<ul>

					<li>The deck is an ordinary pinewood board from a hardware store. It has 125x25 cm.</li>

					<li>The mast is a piece of timber that measures 190 cm in height and 2x5 cm in width.</li>

					<li>The foremast is a combination of a piece of timber and a thin pole.</li>

					<li>The steering wheel is mounted on another piece of timber. To create it, first I drew the cut out lines, then I drilled holes with en electric drill, and finally I cut on the lines using a narrow-bladed electrical saw.</li>

					<li>For attaching the masts to the deck I used small corner brackets.</li>

					<li>For the rotative elements (wheel, boom) I used screws with 2 nuts tightened on each other so that the the rotative element doesn't go anywhere and can rotate freely at the same time.</li>

					<li>For the sails I used some linen that I had available. I cut them to the desired shape, then I burned their margins with the soldering iron.</li>

					<li>To create the mainsail hoisting mechanism, I created some holes on the luff of my linen sail. I took a rope and put it through each hole, alternating sides. On top of the mast I mounted a pulley through which I passed the rope. At the mast base I mounted another pulley which leads the line towards the wheel. Thus I can hoist the sail by pulling at the mast and then taking up the slack at the cockpit, just as on a real boat.</li>

					<li>The wind and tide "indicators" are thin ice-cream sticks, cut out to be pointed, and mounted using drawing pins.</li>

				</ul>

				<p>I would say it took me 16h overall to create it as I presented it above. I made most of it in a single day (say, 8h), then I added elements as they came to my mind.</p>
